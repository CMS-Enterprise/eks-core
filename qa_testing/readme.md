# QA Testing
This directory and subdirectories are intended to perform the Quality Assurance tasks for this repo.
- DO NOT modify without consulting the QA Team Lead
- This "qa_testing" directory is intended to be completely independent and not rely on external directories, scripts, or tools.  That way external file changes will not result in breaking dependencies for the QA Testing components and functionality.
